Relentlessly Craving by Julia Fiedorczuk

poem, poem be strong
like a shock wave, Griegâ€™s Concerto in A Minor
put down roots, find the source, bloom, bear fruit
come to life, poem, I need your blood 

poem, poem be as perilously lovely
as the drunken woman in the painting by Munch
what counts are only the base colors, yellow, black, red
what counts is fire 

there is a time for hope
and a time for despair 

what counts is fire
if you have no flesh
you do not know love
nor do you know death

poem, poem be in the sun
in the eye of the world
in the turning of bread into motion
in the constant decay that is the condition of all synthesis
in the blood

fire, be 

there is a time for hope
and a time for despair
what counts is fire and ice

poem, poem be like the dark night of the soul
